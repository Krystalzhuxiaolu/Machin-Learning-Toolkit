# Machin-Learning-Toolkit

A set of machine learning templates that would be handy to use for later projects, including:
1. Suerpvised learning: Regression and classification
2. Unsupervised learning: although the accuracy of unsupervised learning is hard to quantify, in quantitative finance, it is widely used in de-noising datasets, portfolio/asset clustering, market regime detection and trading signal generation with natural language processing
3. Natural Language Processing, the NLTK and Spacy packages has their own obvious drawbacks, needs to explore further
4. Deep Learning
